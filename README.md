# Build a Client Project

[Teachers' Project Briefs](https://docs.google.com/a/devbootcamp.com/document/d/1Kmw125hcNvyA_v4e35__TADi5NP88ELdhVfzPSlyAIc/edit?usp=sharing)

### Learning Competencies

- Interfacing with clients to determine the specification for building an application, in the form of user stories.
- Using a formal Agile group process to complete a successful development project.

### Summary

Let's put all of our knowledge thus far to the test and build someone a real web application!

The goal is for this challenge to simulate (albeit in a compressed form) the process of interacting with clients, building prototypes for them, and iterating based upon their feedback - all while working together as a team and following development and deployment best practices.
